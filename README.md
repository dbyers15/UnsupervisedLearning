According to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/stroke/facts.htm):
- “In 2018, 1 out of 6 deaths from cardiovascular disease was due to stroke” 
- “Someone in the USA has a stroke every 40 seconds”
- “Every 4 minutes, someone dies of stroke”
- “The chances of survival are greater when emergency treatment begins quickly.” 

 ### **Early action is important for stroke**

Therefore, we wanted to analyze stroke-related health indicator data collected from patients to see if there are any obvious clusters that can contribute to early stroke prediction and detection. 

We use Factor Analysis of Mixed Data (FAMD) and Spectral Clustering to see if we can find any hidden variables that could aid in stroke prediction.
